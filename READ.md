# R.O.D's API Template

Welcome to **R.O.D's API Template**, a comprehensive starter kit for building robust and scalable APIs. This project is designed to provide developers with a fully functional backend and frontend template for creating APIs with ease.

## Features
- Fully coded backend with Node.js and Express.
- User authentication using JWT.
- Database integration with MongoDB.
- Frontend built with React for seamless integration.
- Ready-to-use CRUD operations.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (ensure it's running if you're hosting it locally)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### Backend

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/lifelessrose/API-TEMPLATE.git](https://github.com/lifelessrose/API-TEMPLATE.git)
    cd API-TEMPLATE
    ```

2.  Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or if you use yarn
    # yarn install
    ```

4.  Set up environment variables:
    * Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory by copying the `.env.example` file.
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    * Update the `.env` file with your specific configurations, such as:
        ```env
        PORT=3001
        MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
        JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
        ```

5.  Run the backend server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or for development with nodemon, if configured
    # npm run dev
    ```
    The backend server should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:PORT`.

### Frontend

1.  Navigate to the frontend directory (from the root `API-TEMPLATE` folder):
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    # or if you are in the root API-TEMPLATE folder:
    # cd frontend
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or if you use yarn
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  Set up environment variables (if needed):
    * If your React app needs to know the API endpoint, you might create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory:
        ```env
        REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
        ```

4.  Run the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or if you use yarn
    # yarn start
    ```
    The React development server should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage / API Endpoints

Once both the backend and frontend are running:
- Access the frontend application at `http://localhost:3000`.
- The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:3001/api`.

Key API endpoints might include:
- `POST /api/users/register` - Register a new user.
- `POST /api/users/login` - Login an existing user.
- `GET /api/items` - Get a list of items.
- ... (add more of your primary endpoints)

Consider providing a Postman collection or Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for easier API testing and exploration.
